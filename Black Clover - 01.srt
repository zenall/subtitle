00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,410
A Village Out in the Boonies: Hage

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,260
Here we go again...

4
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,900
There, there...

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,250
There you are.

6
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,600
Those two finally calmed down.

7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,230
Are they brothers... or perhaps twins?

8
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,050
No, they're not.

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,380
This one is rather calm, but this one...

10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,030
seems like he has a lot of spunk.

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,950
First of all, they don't look a thing alike.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,070
Hm? "Yuno"...

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,250
Let's see. And the spunky one over here is—

14
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,450
Hey! You're a bit too spunky...

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,150
"Asta," eh?

16
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,870
Right! You two don't need to
worry about a thing anymore.

17
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,020
Starting today, this is your new home...

18
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,310
Asta, Yuno.

19
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,010
15 Years Later

20
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,580
Hopefully, we'll have a
great harvest this year.

21
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,710
Yeah.

22
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,780
Hup.

23
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,810
Sister Lily!

24
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,080
What the...

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,180
Must be that runt from the church again.

26
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,060
I'll become the Wizard King
someday and make you happy!

27
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,020
So please marry me!

28
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,460
I'm sorry, Asta, but I'm everyone's sister.

29
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,100
Not yet!

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,900
Um... I'm sorry.

31
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,260
I'm not giving up yet!

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,240
Er, um... But...

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,450
I'm not giving up!

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,390
I'm really sorry!

35
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,500
One more time, Sister Lily!

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,800
Stop pestering me!

37
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,220
Water Creation Magic: Holy Fist of Love!

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,010
I-I'm sorry, Asta.

39
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,020
I used magic from my
grimoire without thinking...

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,910
Well done, sister.

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,560
No mercy whatsoever.

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,020
I-I... It just happened..

43
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,860
I'm not done yet!

44
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,260
Sheesh.

45
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,080
How many times does she have to dump you?

46
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,180
Why are you getting in my way too, Yuno?!

47
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,590
Why?

48
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,200
Because you're loud, short,

49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:23,090
Loud

50
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,090
Short

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,110
obnoxious, and immature.

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,090
Obnoxious

53
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,090
Immature

54
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,090
Basically, you're not appealing
to women in any way.

55
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,360
Not appealing

56
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,180
Hey! Is that what you say to
someone you've grown up with

57
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,250
for the past fifteen years,
you handsome jerk?!

58
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,420
Let me give you a hand.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,340
Thanks.

60
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,830
Don't ignore me, damn it!

61
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,850
Asta, Sister Lily is a woman of the cloth,
so she can't get married.

62
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,260
Also, you're only fifteen,
so you can't get married anyway.

63
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,870
Shut up! Yuno, you jerk... I oughta...

64
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,870
I challenge you to a fight, Yuno!

65
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,930
And I decline.

66
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,670
Why the hell not?!

67
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,060
Because it's a waste of time.

68
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,270
What'd you say?!

69
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,680
Give it a rest, Asta.
There's no way you can beat Yuno.

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,180
Take this...

71
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,060
My ultimate...

72
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,180
Hold up, Asta.

73
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,010
Attack!

74
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,010
I mean, you can't even use magic.

75
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,300
Nothing came out!

76
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,950
I'm not done yet!

77
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,210
You're funny, Asta!

78
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,320
You have zero sense.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,860
It's hard to believe someone
your age can't use magic yet.

80
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,130
The hell's your problem?! How dare
you speak to your elders that way?!

81
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,380
Shut up.

82
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,500
Magic is everything in this world.

83
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,240
It's only natural to be able to use magic.

84
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,590
You're the only one I've ever
seen who can't use it, Asta.

85
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,890
G-Guess I don't have a choice...

86
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,550
I'll have to show you what
I'm really made of...

87
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,220
What you're really made of?

88
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,730
How you like that?! I know you
can't do sit-ups this fast!

89
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,670
What's your point, you idiot?

90
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,860
You're funny, Asta!

91
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,250
Yuno's so cool!

92
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,200
That's Yuno for you.

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,980
He's such a great help.

94
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,480
Then leave... the wood-chopping...

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,380
to me!

96
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,090
I still can't believe you
two are the same age.

97
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,230
Yuno is the hope of this church!

98
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,060
I won't be surprised if you end up joining

99
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,110
the Magic Knights who serve
the Wizard King, Yuno!

100
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,680
The awarding ceremony is coming up, Asta.

101
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,540
Once you receive your grimoire,

102
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,180
it should trigger something within you,
and you should be able to use magic, too.

103
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,380
Sister...

104
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,700
At least, I think so.

105
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,930
I'll get my grimoire soon...

106
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,710
Finally... Finally!

107
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,180
I'll get a grimoire that's more
amazing than anyone else's,

108
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,010
get into the Magic Knights,
follow in your footsteps,

109
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,640
and become the Wizard King!

110
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,930
There he goes again.

111
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,430
And I'll fix up this shabby, ugly church!

112
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,910
Well, I'm sorry it's so shabby and ugly!

113
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,020
Right, Yuno?

114
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,090
Right?

115
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,700
Just you wait...

116
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,720
Just you wait, damn it!

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,900
Asta, wait!

118
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,580
Is he really older than me?

119
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,890
Say, Yuno... Couldn't you
be a bit nicer to Asta?

120
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,070
Like you used to be. Remember how you two
were always together when you were little?

121
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,070
Yuno used to be such a crybaby,

122
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,160
but ever since the day he brought
Asta back with those terrible injuries,

123
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,390
Yuno hasn't cried at all.

124
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,420
I can't be nicer to him.

125
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:30,020
Come to think of it, Asta has come home
covered in mud ever since that day, too.

126
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,180
I wonder what he's doing out there...

127
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,540
994... 995, 996,

128
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:46,790
997, 998, 999... 1,000!

129
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,740
And now for this moguro leaf juice,
which is supposed to be

130
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,950
good for increasing magical powers!

131
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm going to become the Wizard King.

132
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,510
That's the one thing I'll never give up on!

133
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,970
But before that, I need to build myself up!

134
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,980
March... When firefly dandelion fluff
starts to dance through the air.

135
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,670
Once a year, all around the Clover Kingdom,
all of the 15-year-olds are gathered,

136
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:32,130
Grimoire Tower

137
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,380
and an awarding ceremony
is held, where they receive

138
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,980
their own grimoires, which
enhance their magical powers.

139
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,030
Wow!

140
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,010
A-Are all of these grimoires?

141
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,040
Which one is mine?

142
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,790
Once I get my grimoire, I'm sure
I'll be able to use magic, too.

143
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,790
I'll catch up to Yuno in no time!

144
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,160
Hmph. I guess today's the day
I become a full-fledged mage.

145
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,590
Hey, look over there.

146
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:02,600
Pathetic, isn't it? They shouldn't have
to give grimoires to dregs like that.

147
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,760
You said it.

148
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,390
Don't tell me they're

149
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,980
actually planning on taking the
Magic Knights' entrance exams, too.

150
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,570
Only nobles born with immense magical power
or ties to the royal family ever get in.

151
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,860
Besides, I heard that shrimp
can't even use magic!

152
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,500
Wow... Then we need to take good care of him.

153
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,670
He's like a national treasure,
since he's probably

154
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,210
the only one in this whole
kingdom who can't use magic.

155
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,010
Welcome, young men and women.

156
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,590
You all begin a new journey today.

157
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,760
I wish you all faith, hope, and love.

158
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,640
I am the master of this grimoire tower.

159
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,230
We've never had a Wizard King from this area,

160
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,900
nor anyone who's actually achieved
greatness in the Magic Knights.

161
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,950
I sincerely hope that one of you
will become the Wizard King someday.

162
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,410
No, really! Seriously!

163
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,910
Ahem.

164
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,540
Now it's time

165
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,870
for the awarding... of the grimoires!

166
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,730
This is my grimoire?

167
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,650
Check it out! Mine's bigger!

168
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,580
Mine's thicker, though.

169
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,790
All right! Now I can leave
this town and go to the city.

170
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,690
I'm gonna take over the family business.

171
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,160
This is my grimoire?

172
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,420
Mine's like...

173
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,620
I'll... think about my future more once
my grimoire has more pages filled in.

174
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,830
We'll be taking the Magic Knights'
entrance exams in six months.

175
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,550
We'll be sure to get in.

176
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,510
Good, good. I look forward to it.

177
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,560
Um...

178
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,770
My grimoire's not coming.

179
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,570
Um...

180
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,570
My grimoire's not coming.

181
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Er...

182
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,830
Try again next year.

183
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,000
What?!

184
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,240
What the heck?!

185
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,840
That's actually amazing!

186
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,340
That's way too funny!

187
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,200
Seriously?

188
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,180
I can't believe it.

189
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,220
If we competed to see who was most pathetic,
we'd be no match for that guy.

190
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,810
A four-leaf clover...

191
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,640
A four-leaf? You mean the legendary...

192
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,080
H-Hey...

193
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,470
The one that the first Wizard King received?

194
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,500
The grimoire said to be filled
with immense power and good luck?

195
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,150
Him?

196
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,930
That peasant?

197
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,300
Wow!

198
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,260
I'm going to become the Wizard King.

199
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,990
Awesome!

200
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,110
He's the shining star of Hage!

201
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,980
You're amazing, Yuno!

202
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,320
He's so cool.

203
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,450
Yuno...

204
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,420
Just you wait.

205
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,200
I'll catch up to you in no time.

206
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,210
Because I'm your rival!

207
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,700
Did he just say "rival"?

208
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,970
He didn't even get a grimoire.
What is he thinking?

209
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,370
Not possible.

210
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,870
All right, kids! We're heading
home to prepare for the feast!

211
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,160
You can each have three tatoes today!

212
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,200
Yay!

213
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,540
I sure would like to eat something
else once in a while.

214
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,940
What an amazing thing to find
in a crummy little town like this.

215
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,110
I thought that once I got my grimoire,

216
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,070
I'd be able to use magic, but...

217
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,060
I never thought I wouldn't even get one.

218
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,750
But... like hell I'm gonna give up!

219
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,630
Don't you dare underestimate me, fate!

220
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,500
I'll show you!

221
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,970
Even if it takes one, two,
ten, or a hundred years!

222
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,170
I'll keep working hard
until I get my grimoire!

223
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,330
I'll become the Wizard King, and prove
to everyone that anyone can be awesome,

224
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,510
even if they're poor or just some orphan!

225
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,470
You jerk!

226
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,720
Just you wait, Yuno!

227
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,140
H-Hey, you don't have to go that far.

228
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,860
We should've been the stars today.

229
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,820
And yet... this peasant receives
a four-leaf clover?!

230
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,240
I'll just...

231
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,250
Hey!

232
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,820
I'll just have to turn it into ash!

233
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,390
He held back my flames without
even using his grimoire?!

234
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,390
D-Do something!

235
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,870
But...

236
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,870
Do it!

237
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,360
I can't let you go and burn that.

238
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,990
Don't bother to resist.

239
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,770
My Creation Magic: Binding Iron Chain

240
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,540
restricts the magic and movements
of the one it captures.

241
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,950
Who are you?

242
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:53,050
Until recently, I was a pretty well-known
Magic Knight called Revchi of Chain Magic.

243
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,060
But I got kicked out, so now
I'm just a wretched thief.

244
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,060
And I'll be taking that grimoire.

245
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,570
Revchi, was it? It's pointless
for you to steal that.

246
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,640
The only one—

247
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,150
The only one who can use a
grimoire is the one it chose.

248
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,920
However, underground collectors
are buying grimoires

249
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,580
with four-leaf clovers for insane prices.

250
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,330
A four-leaf clover may have chosen you,

251
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,100
but you only just received it.
You're still just a little chick.

252
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,580
How unfortunate for you that
I happened to be here.

253
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,090
Your legend is going to end
before it even begins.

254
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,820
Hey, that pendant looks like
it's worth something, too.

255
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,420
I guess I'll be taking that...

256
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,270
Hold it!

257
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,030
What do you think you're doing?!

258
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,780
I've come to save...

259
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,530
Huh?

260
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,080
Who the hell are you?!

261
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,140
That's Yuno's grimoire!

262
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,210
Why do you have it? You thief!

263
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,420
Aren't you the pathetic little brat
who wasn't even given a grimoire?

264
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,690
Oh, you remember me!

265
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,100
Yeah, I'm that pathetic little brat!

266
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,850
A grimoire is precious to
the person who received it!

267
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,410
Give it back to Yuno, you jerk!

268
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,900
The outside world is a place where crooked
deeds like this can be overlooked.

269
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,730
But you'll be dead before you
find that out for yourself.

270
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,700
Asta, run!

271
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,430
I'm not going to run away

272
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,250
from a disgraced loser like him!

273
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,110
I'm not done yet!

274
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,190
No... You're finished.

275
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,150
Dance of the Pitless Viper!

276
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,830
Wh-What a heavy blow...

277
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,830
So this is the power of the mages
from outside this town.

278
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,090
I can't possibly beat him
with just my physical training.

279
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,250
Thank you for that useless struggle, brat.

280
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,430
Not yet. I'm not finished...

281
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm going to be... the Wizard King.

282
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,060
You? The Wizard King?

283
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
I have the ability to find out

284
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,730
just how much magical power
one has with these chains.

285
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,940
And you have no magic whatsoever.

286
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,950
You must've been born that way.
No wonder you couldn't get a grimoire.

287
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,540
To think that you lack
even an ounce of magic

288
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,790
in this world where magic is everything.

289
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,370
What a priceless find!

290
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,120
Huh?

291
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,790
What the hell?

292
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,590
Then no matter how hard I try,
I won't be able to use magic?

293
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,260
To think that someone so pathetic existed.

294
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,630
You won't even be able to find a job,
let alone become the Wizard King!

295
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:33,530
I'm sure your friend, the great
genius over there, mocks you, too.

296
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,650
Yeah, maybe.

297
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,420
Yuno's so amazing that he
was chosen by the four-leaf.

298
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,280
I'm just...

299
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,490
You can't do a thing in this world.
Just give up on everything.

300
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,460
You were born a loser!

301
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,170
He's right.

302
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,500
No matter how hard I try,
some things just can't be helped.

303
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,260
I'm just going to give...

304
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,510
Hey!

305
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,680
Who are you calling a loser?

306
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,350
Asta, it's true that you won't be
able to become the Wizard King,

307
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,990
no matter what.

308
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,110
You hear that? Even your little friend
is telling you it's impossible.

309
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,400
That's because I'm going
to become the Wizard King!

310
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,800
What?

311
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,570
He's no loser.

312
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,950
He's...

313
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,870
Asta's my rival!

314
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,970
Huh?

315
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,810
Him? Your rival?

316
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,210
This brat who has no
magical power whatsoever?

317
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,170
Not... Not yet.

318
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,520
Sorry you had to see me
looking that pathetic, Yuno.

319
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,140
Just a sec...

320
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,060
I'm gonna kick this guy's butt!

321
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,370
A gri... moire?

322
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,710
I knew it.

323
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,000
There's no way that Asta
wouldn't have been chosen!

324
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,790
Your magic?

325
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,100
But you didn't have any magic within you!

326
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,090
What in the world is that grimoire?!

327
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:47,070
The three leaves of the clover
represent faith, hope, and love.

328
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,500
Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.

329
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,790
Within a fifth leaf...

330
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,620
resides a demon.

331
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,480
Asta and Yuno

332
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,560
I'm not going to give up just
because I can't use magic!

333
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,810
It doesn't matter if you're a peasant or
an orphan! Anyone can shine in this world!

The Boys' Promise

336
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,740
Not giving up is my magic!
